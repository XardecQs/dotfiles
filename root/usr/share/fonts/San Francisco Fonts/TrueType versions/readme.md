# TrueType (TTF) versions
Found in the [font CSS](https://www.apple.com/wss/fonts) on offical Apple website. Note that Apple CSS is not accessible with direct link, you have to visit Apple website so the CSS is cached.

This TrueType version is designed for Windows screen (especially with small DPI), it is sharper and more legible than OpenType (OTF) version even the font size is small. The OTF version is blurrier and less legible if the font size is smaller than 12px; however, the OTF version is more detailed than the TTF one if the font size is large enough. macOS and Linux have better font rendering than Windows so OTF is usually the prefered option. Some Windows apps do not support OTF.
